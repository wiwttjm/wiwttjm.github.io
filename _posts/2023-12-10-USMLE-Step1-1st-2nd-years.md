1. Try to do well on your modules. Build a solid foundation of anatomy, biochem and physiology.

2. Even though its not part of curriculum at your stage, I'd advise that try to study basics of pathology, microbiology and pharmacology with quite a bit of repetition in your first 2 years alongside regular coursework. Micro, biochem and pharm are memorization intensive so require multiple reviews to have the ABCs ingrained in your brain.

3. 3rd year will become easier and you can rapidly build up your knowledge base on a solid foundation.

4. Aim to give your step 1 by early 4th year, this will allow you to plan electives with and adequate timeline and all the available options would be open for you. Also you will be able to enjoy clinical rotations more with your solid knowledge base and no added stress of studying for a big exam. Plus you can focus on research at this point too.

5. Find a mentor early on and have them curate a study strategy for you.

**Great resources for 1st & 2nd Year**

Osmosis for physio, kenhub (online atlas for anatomy), Ninja Nerd. For physio, my advice is to always watch a video before reading the topic from Guyton and/or costanzo. Also for anatomy, see the atlas before reading text. For Biochem, see divine intervention 3 part episode series on youtube, dirty medicine biochem playlist on youtube for awesome mnemonics and keeping things simplified and ninja nerd vids for anything you find confusing.
