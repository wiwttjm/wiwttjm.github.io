1. Obviously you do have some baseline knowledge but if you weren't paying attention during the prior years, don't worry. Time to cover for those gaps.

2. I hope you have at least gone through pathoma and sketchy micro at least once at this point and know some random pharma. If not go through pathoma first (see 3rd Year strategy).

3. Then I'd advise start directly with divine intervention podcasts (see the writeup on how to use divine intervention podcasts) and follow along from first aid those topics. Maybe annotate or not. More important than just making notes is developing a deeper understanding of the material and identifying and separating similar/confusing pathologies, concepts and facts.

4. Do a broad review of major systems like cardio, renal, endo, pulmo. (these are interlinked more so than others). Understand and drill the autonomic drugs and system in your brain.

5. Leave rest of neuro, psych, derm, msk,  reproductive systems for now.

6. Start Uworld. Maintain consistency, it'll be very hard with rotations and everything but do push yourself. (You can do it).

7. Now also start covering the systems you left previously alongside, also you will have psych rotation, do set a schedule to learn material or go through all of it if possible before going to the psych clinics. Will provide with motivation when you know your stuff there.

8. Maintain consistency and keep doing your thing.
Schedule exam for any upcoming vacations or any other suitable timeframe.

9. Exam time, go and crush it. You got this.

**Additional 2 points regarding electives**

- If in 5th year, and you have an opportunity to do an elective in the US and not  yet taken step and would not be taking step till at least 3 months after you graduate, then go for the electives. But if your timeline and prep allows to be able to be done with step 1 within 3 months post-final year prof, I'd recommend just be done with your step 1 and plan your electives/observerships for post Step 1.

- Remember electives is separate problem, visa is separate one, and giving the exam is a separate problem. Although all are interwined in some way but require separate solutions as well. Meaning you have to work on these simultaneously rather than in tandem.

**Note on using divine intervention**

>- There is a well organized podcast topic list spreadsheet on the website, use it to figure out the episode numbers for the topics and topic series.
>- The episode numbering is in order of the release but not in order of related content. (e.g like episode 53, episode 70, episode 85, might be part 1, 2, 3 of a certain topic. so you need to listen in order of content chronology)
>- There are video lecture series on youtube too with the relevant slide decks found on website for the same episode.
>- Be mindful of the time take to listen and also account for multiple rewinds you might have to do sometimes to catch the exactly what is being said. So a 1 hour episode might actually take 1.5 hours to listen to properly.
