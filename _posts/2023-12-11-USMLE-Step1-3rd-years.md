1. Unlink yourself from the college curriculum pace. You will have to go faster than the college curriculum and aim cover all the systems by mid or at least before last quarter of your academic
year.

2. No use/need to do any electives, you'll get a proper chance later on. I would even discourage research in this year, you can work on 1-2 projects but don't overburden yourself, you will get plenty of great opportunities agay.

3. Start with basics of microbiology, pharma and patho. Go through whole of Pathoma vids (you can raise speed upto 2x if you are able to follow along, my sweet spot used to be 1.5x - 1.75x, interestingly if the speed is faster, you are more likely to not zone out as you actively have to concentrate now to follow along) along with text. Highlight, annotate, write/make mnemonics. No need to actively memorize stuff rn important is to get familiar and know the bigger picture. Many systems are interlinked and pathologies multisystem. Similarly go through sketchy Micro once.

4. Then start with BnB videos and watch for systems and I think BnB micro is great too. Refer to FA alongside. (Go through Pharma parts, but don't fret too much about them)

5. Do a quick biochem review from divine intervention 3 episode series and dirty medicine playlist, refer to FA alongside.

6. I think at this point probably you are ready to start Uworld (good idea to get a year of subscription).

7. Watch sketchy pharma vids alongside to help retain drugs in memory. (again some people find it helpful, some find it additionally confusing, try and see for yourself).
If anki is your style, maybe incorporate it around this time to help with spaced repetition memorization.

8. Just keep following your study plan now for a few months onwards and keep up with consistency.

9. Book your exam date around 2-3 months in advance preferably, otherwise finding a date is a problem.

10. Around 3 months from your intended exam date, start doing practice exams (NBMEs, give UWSA 1, a few weeks before).

11. See what areas you are lacking in and review those areas. Maybe try to understand that topic from another resource if understanding problem, if memorization retaining problem, use the same resource as used before.

12. Time for the exam. Go and crush it. You got this.
